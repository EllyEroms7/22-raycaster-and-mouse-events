## Jengo Game

Jenga is a physical skill game where players take turns removing one block at a time from a tower constructed of 54 wooden blocks. Each removed block is then placed on top of the tower, creating a progressively taller and more unstable structure. The game ends when the tower falls, and the player who caused the collapse loses.
